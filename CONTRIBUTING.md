# Contributing

Fork the repo at https://github.com/impact-crater/impact-crater-core

## Branches
Use [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

What's on ```master``` should always be published on npm. ```dev``` should contain what will be the next version of impact-crater.

New functionality/massive refactoring should occur in a feature branch.

Even if you have commit priveliges please commit and open pull requests for your branch so we can test/discuss things rather than committing straight to the repo.
